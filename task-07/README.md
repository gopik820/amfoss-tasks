I have installed all the flutter packages and also android studio in my laptop and was  able to create all the tabs. I also was able to implement the dotted tabs in the UI but I couldnt bring all the rest into a single unit. So in conclusion I was not able to complete the task but I will try to learn more about it and continue doing it.
