I have installed all the flutter packages and also android studio in my laptop and was even able to create all the tabs and was also able to implement the dotted tabs in the UI but I couldnt bring all the rest into a single unit. So in conclusion I was not able to complete the task but I will try to learn more about it and continue doing it.
