# INTROSPECTION

# Why must we choose you?
I always found programming and coding interesting and it is one of the only few things that I still love to do, unlike my habit of stopping in between or discountinuing something I no longer found exciting. I dont know if it is a good thing or a bad one but I am like really open and friendly and I really like working in teams.This club could help me learn a lot about how to build up my career to how to be more compatible as a team.The vast knowledge of the seniors in the club could help me in learning and improving my knowledge. A club such as this which helps everyone by improving their own area of expertise is hard to come across and I would like to be a part of it.

# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Because of this pandemic situation we all are stuck at home and I dont think that we might be able to come to college in the next six months. So I would like to use this time productivily . Well its not gonna be only studies but I do have a aim or you could say a target to reach and I hope that I might be able to reach that.If I become a part of this club I would like to learn more deeply about the languages that I know rather than just touching the surfaces of many languages with the help of my mentors and seniors.And if I dont get into this club I would still continue to learn more about coding even though it might not be as effective as getting in.

# How would you contribute back to the club?
I would help the club in its sole aim and that is contributing to the open source community. I am more of team player and so would do great in a team and help the club in various ways.And in the future  when I will also be a senior in the club I would help my juniors in the same way as my mentors did and help in continuing the legacy of this club.

# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
For me it seems that the tasks are challenging but I do not know whether that is a common thought.My only suggestion for the process is that they could try to make tasks according to the individual's area of expertise and achievements.
