Hey my name Gopi and I am an S1 student in Amrita College of Engineering CSE (Batch A)
# About me

I was born and brought up in this small city in Kerala known as Trivandrum.To be honest I wouldnt say that Amrita was my first choice but I later on realised that
studying in Amrita might be the best decision I have taken so far.The induction programs,the various clubs which helps us in building our career,the well trained faculty members and the always helping seniors were a big help for me.I first started learning about computers when I was in like 4th grade or something and I started to get this interest into the field or you could say this world of computers.I started learning languages only at higher classses of which the ones I always wanted to learn more was Java and C++ .I wouldnt say that I am really good in these but I do know the basics.Afterwards I have been trying to learn more languages and also learn more deeply about the languages I already know.Thats when I came across this awesome club called FOSS which is a really cool place for me to learn something new everyday and also help me get more knowledge about the things that I like.
