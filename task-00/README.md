I had previously installed Ubuntu in my desktop and didnt have any error that time but I never used it that much. But this time I installed it in my laptop and encountered a few errors.I came across a PCIe error while installing and from what I understood it occurs when linux wants to show us that there is some problem in the hardware.I knew that since Ubuntu is an open source operating system that many people might have come across the problem and atleast some developers have found out a solution. So I went and serched on Google and came across this article that helped me in fixing my error.(https://markhamilton.info/installation-issues-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/)
